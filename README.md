# Pandas-Practice-Questions

## Introduction
As I was learning Pandas, I realized that while there are plenty of tutorials and articles available, there weren't many resources focused on **practical application**. I wanted a way to not only understand the theory behind pandas but also to **actively practice** the concepts and reinforce my learning through real problems. That's when the idea of creating this repository came to life.

The primary goal of this project is to offer a structured way for people to **apply their pandas knowledge**. It provides exercises that allow you to put your skills to the test and see how well you can handle real-world tasks with pandas. By solving these exercises, you can go beyond theoretical learning and gain hands-on experience that will help you become proficient in pandas.

## How to Use This Repository

To make the most out of this repository, **first learn a concept** by following a tutorial or reading an article. Then, you can start solving the exercises in this repository to apply what you've learned. The repository contains three types of files:

1. **Exercise Instructions with Questions**: These files include questions designed to help you practice specific concepts and improve your pandas skills.
2. **Solutions without Code**: These files explain the solution to each exercise in words, helping you understand the logic behind the code without giving away the exact implementation.
3. **Solutions with Code and Questions**: These files provide both the questions and the complete code solution, serving as a helpful reference to see how the concepts are applied in practice.

## Inspiration

The idea for this repository was inspired by the "**[pandas_exercises](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises)**" repository. I really admired the concept behind it and wanted to build something similar, but with my own twist. While I’ve taken some inspiration from how that repository is structured, all the exercises and solutions here are entirely original — **no data** has been copied. My goal is to offer new challenges that help others apply their pandas knowledge in practical, real-world scenarios.

# Index of Pandas Practice Exercises

This repository is organized into several folders, each dedicated to a specific concept in pandas. Below is the index of all the topics with links to each respective directory.

## Folder Structure

2. **[DataFrame-1](./02.%20DataFrame-1)**: Introduction to DataFrames, creation, and simple manipulations.

3. **[DataFrame-2](./03.%20DataFrame-2)**: Intermediate operations on DataFrames such as filtering, sorting, and handling missing data.

4. **[DataFrame-3](./04.%20DataFrame-3)**: Advanced DataFrame techniques, including multi-indexing and hierarchical indexing.

5. **[Handling Text Data](./05.%20Handling%20Text%20Data)**: Learn to handle text-based data in pandas, including string operations and regular expressions.

6. **[Multindex](./06.%20Multindex)**: Working with multi-indexing in pandas to manage and manipulate hierarchical data.

7. **[GroupBy Object](./07.%20GroupBy%20Object)**: Explore grouping data and performing aggregations with the `groupby` method.

8. **[Merging, Joining, and Concatenating](./08.%20Merging%20Joining%20and%20Concatenating)**: Techniques for combining data from multiple sources using merge, join, and concatenation.

9. **[Date and Time](./09.%20Date%20and%20Time)**: Handling time series data, date parsing, and working with time-related operations.

10. **[Data Visualization](./10.%20Data%20Visualization)**: Visualizing data using pandas and integrating with libraries like matplotlib for enhanced plots.

## Contributions and Feedback

I’d be really grateful for any **feedback**, **contributions**, or **suggestions**! I’m constantly working on adding new exercises and resources to make this repository more helpful for anyone looking to enhance their pandas skills. So, if you have any ideas or recommendations, they’d be greatly appreciated and will help improve the resource for everyone.
